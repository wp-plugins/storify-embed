Easily embed Storify streams into your blog

== Description ==

With this plugin, you can post the URLs of Storify stream, just in the same way you would with
YouTube videos or Flickr photos. Put the URL of a Storify page on a new line in your post,
and it will be replaced with the stream from storify.com.

This is a simple alternative to the more full-featured Storify plugin, and simply provides
embedding on WordPress network sites that don't support pasting of script or iframe tags.

== Installation ==

Just download the plugin from the WordPress directory or install it directly from the WordPress admin dashboard.

To install the plugin from the wordpress.org plugin directory:

1. Download `storify-embed.zip`,
2. Unzip it and upload the `storify-embed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress,
